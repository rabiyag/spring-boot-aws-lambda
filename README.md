# AWS Lambda Setup for Spring Boot Application

## Overview
This document outlines the steps required to set up an AWS Lambda function that integrates with your Spring Boot application. It covers the configuration of AWS services and the necessary permissions to ensure seamless interaction between the Lambda function and your application.

## Prerequisites
- An **AWS Account** with the necessary permissions to create Lambda functions, IAM roles, and manage AWS resources.
- The Spring Boot application code set up for AWS Lambda integration.

## AWS Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Create an IAM Role for Lambda
1. Go to the **IAM Dashboard** in the AWS Console.
2. Click on **Roles**, then click **Create role**.
3. Select **Lambda** as the service that will use this role.
4. Click **Next: Permissions**.
5. Attach the following policies:
   - **AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole** (to allow logging to CloudWatch).
   - Any additional policies required for your application (e.g., access to DynamoDB, S3, etc.).
6. Click **Next: Tags** and add any tags if needed.
7. Click **Next: Review**.
8. Provide a name for the role (e.g., `MyLambdaExecutionRole`) and create the role.

### Step 2: Create a Lambda Function
1. Go to the **AWS Lambda Console**.
2. Click on **Create function**.
3. Choose **Author from scratch**.
4. Fill in the following details:
   - **Function name**: Provide a name for your function (e.g., `MyLambdaFunction`).
   - **Runtime**: Select the appropriate Java version (e.g., Java 11).
   - **Permissions**: Choose the IAM role you created in Step 1.
5. Click on **Create function**.

### Step 3: Deploy Your Lambda Function
1. In the **Function code** section, you can either upload a JAR file or write code inline.
   - To upload a JAR file:
     - Build your Spring Boot application and package it into a JAR using Maven:
       ```bash
       mvn clean package
       ```
     - Upload the JAR file containing your Lambda function (ensure it includes only the necessary Lambda code if packaged with Spring Boot).
2. Click **Deploy** to save your changes.

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables (Optional)
- You can configure environment variables that your Lambda function may require (e.g., database connection strings, API keys):
  1. In the **Configuration** tab of your Lambda function, select **Environment variables**.
  2. Click on **Edit** and add key-value pairs for your environment variables.
  3. Click **Save**.

### Step 5: Set Up API Gateway (Optional)
If you want to expose your Lambda function as a REST API:
1. Go to the **API Gateway Console**.
2. Click **Create API** and select **HTTP API** or **REST API**.
3. Follow the steps to create a new API.
4. Set up an integration with your Lambda function.
5. Deploy the API and note the endpoint URL for invoking your Lambda function.

### Step 6: Test Your Lambda Function
1. In the Lambda console, select your function.
2. Click on the **Test** tab.
3. Create a new test event with sample input.
4. Run the test to ensure the Lambda function executes successfully.

### Step 7: Modify Security Group (If Required)
- If your Lambda function needs to access resources in a VPC:
  1. Go to the **VPC Console**.
  2. Find the security group associated with your Lambda function and modify inbound/outbound rules as needed to allow traffic.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that your Lambda function has permissions to access any AWS services that your application requires.
- Monitor the Lambda function's logs using **Amazon CloudWatch Logs** to debug and track its execution.
- Consider setting up alerts for failed invocations or throttled requests in CloudWatch.
